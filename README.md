# CARD-EFFECT-NO-JS
A 3D image card hover effect using only HTML and CSS. When hovering, the focused image pops out in 3D while adjacent images rotate and adjust brightness. Features include CSS `transform` for depth, smooth transitions, and a flexbox layout for responsive design. Great for galleries and creative websites.
